## üåü Key Features

### üì± Mobile-Friendly Design
Access your flashcards from any device - whether you're on your phone, tablet, or computer. The app can be installed directly on your device for quick access, just like a native application. Study offline without an internet connection, and when you're back online, your progress automatically syncs across all your devices.

### üéØ Smart Learning System
Our scientifically-proven spaced repetition system adapts to your learning pace. Cards you find challenging will appear more frequently in your reviews, while well-remembered cards show up less often. The system continuously adjusts based on your performance, and you can track your progress with clear mastery indicators that show how well you've learned each card.

### üìö Study Modes

#### 1. Classic Review Mode
The classic review mode offers multiple ways to study. Focus on cards due for review today, go through your entire collection, or concentrate on cards you haven't mastered yet. You can also prioritize your least reviewed cards to ensure balanced learning. Rate your confidence with each card using a four-point scale: Again (1), Hard (2), Good (3), or Easy (4). Use the spacebar to flip cards, and enjoy smooth, beautiful animations that make studying more engaging.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts
Study efficiently with intuitive keyboard shortcuts. Use the spacebar to flip cards, numbers 1-4 to rate cards during review, and arrow keys to navigate between cards. These shortcuts make your study sessions faster and more productive, allowing you to focus on learning rather than navigation.

### üé® Customization
Personalize your learning experience with our customization options. Switch between dark and light modes to suit your preference and reduce eye strain. The modern interface features smooth animations and adapts perfectly to any screen size, ensuring a comfortable study experience across all devices.

## üìä Progress Tracking
Monitor your learning journey with comprehensive progress tracking. View your complete review history, see which cards you've mastered, and keep track of your study streaks. These insights help you understand your learning patterns and maintain consistent study habits.

## üîÑ Smart Scheduling
Our intelligent scheduling system optimizes your learning by considering multiple factors. It takes into account how well you know each card, the time since your last review, your overall performance history, and scientifically-proven spacing intervals for long-term retention. This ensures you review cards at the optimal time for maximum learning efficiency.

## üí° Tips for Best Results
Make the most of your study sessions by reviewing your due cards daily. Use the speed review game when you want quick, focused practice. Always rate your cards honestly based on how well you remember them - this helps the system adapt to your needs. Save time by importing existing cards from CSV files, and use the gallery view to keep your collection organized. Take advantage of offline mode to study anywhere, even without an internet connection.

## üéÆ Getting Started
Begin your learning journey by adding your first cards in the "Add Card" tab. Move on to the "Review" tab to start studying, and try the speed review game when you're ready for a challenge. Use the gallery to manage your growing collection, and don't forget to import any existing cards you may have.
